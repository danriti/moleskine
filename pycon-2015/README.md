# PyCon 2015 Wrap Up

The AppNeta team has just returned from a fantastically fun, edifying, and
exhausting weekend at [PyCon 2015][1]. PyCon was held in Montreal this year,
giving team members the opportunity to brush up on their French, binge on
poutine, and absorb the many fabulous talks given by this year's speakers
(including our very own development manager, Geoff Gerrietts!).

We've compiled a list of some of our favorite talks and hope you enjoy them as
much as we did!

## Katie Schick

* Diversity in engineering is a common topic of debate, discussion, and lengthy
  blog posts--and rightly so. However, it's less common to encounter a narrative
  that not only clearly defines some of the problems but also offers actionable
  solutions to them. Kate Heddleston's well-researched and powerful talk on
  [How our engineering environments are killing diversity][2] accomplished just that.
  The most compelling idea to me was that of accruing "team debt" (alongside your
  technical debt) and how a "lack of on-boarding can hurt people who aren't like
  the existing team." I won't spoil the rest for you, but I highly encourage
  checking out Kate's [blog][3].

* At AppNeta, we spend a lot of time thinking about how best to convey the
  meaning of our mountains of data, so I was really excited about
  Sarah Bird's talk on [Interactive data for the web - Bokeh for web
  developers][4]. It was amazing to see the dynamic, interactive data visualizations
  we could create using only Python! Sarah did a great job of walking us through
  the process of creating a pretty complex Bokeh visualization, while also
  explaining what was going on under the hood.

* Melanie Warrick's talk on [Neural Nets for Newbies][5] took an incredibly
  complex topic and broke it down in a way that truly was for "newbies." As a
  person entirely unfamiliar with neural nets prior to the talk, I really
  appreciated that her goal was not for us to understand everything she said, but
  rather to give us a framework on which to build our continued learning. I walked
  away feeling as though I had a grasp on what neural nets were and how they
  worked and am excited to learn more.

## Geoff Gerrietts

* [The Ethical Consequences of Our Collective Activities][6] leads my list off. Our
  profession has more than a passing resemblance to the practice of law, and it
  should incur similar responsibilities and offer similar privilege. Glyph
  offers a compelling thesis with grace, nuance, and a little bit of
  provocation.

* In [Distributed Systems 101][7] lvh provides a solid grounding in a complicated topic. As web
  developers, we wrestle with distributed systems problems quite frequently --
  "What happens when two web nodes try to write to the same row of the same
  table?" Grounding the discussion of those challenges in distributed systems
  theory makes resolutions clearer and more effective.

* ["Words, Words, Words"][8] harkens back to my origins as a student of English, looking to use computers
  to enhance our literary experience. Adam delivers on this premise, producing
  some real insights in the reading of Othello and the sonnets even within the
  short bounds of this talk.

## Dan Riti

* I was blown away by Jacob Kaplan-Moss's keynote,
  [I Don't Deserve to be Here][10]. Jacob talks about how the mythical
  "10X Programmer" stereotype creates a barrier to entry into the field of
  software engineering and draws comparisons that reinforce how ridiculous this
  idea really is. Highly recommended!

* Our fearless [BDFL][12], Guido van Rossum, speaks in [Type Hints][11] about
  the current state of types in Python. The talk delves deep into [PEP 484][13],
  which introduces a standard syntax for type hints using annotations on
  function definitions for Python 3.5. Before anyone freaks out about types
  in Python, Guido makes it crystal clear that this new addition is completely
  optional and being added to aid teams working on large Python code bases.

* Docker is so hot right now, so I couldn't pass up on checking out
  [Fire your supervisord: running Python apps on CoreOS][14] by Dan Callahan.
  But be warned: this isn't a tutorial on Docker, but an introduction into the
  world of [CoreOS][15]. So, if you've got a solid understanding of Docker but
  want to understand how you can deploy it in production, this is a must watch.


## Conclusion

Here's to another great year of innovation, talks, and programming in the
Python community. See you in [Portland][9] at next year's conference!
